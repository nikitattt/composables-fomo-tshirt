# Dynamic Composable Accessory

## Dynamic accessory that visually changes when itâ€™s time to play FOMO Nouns!

This is Prof Of Concept work to bring dynamic composable traits that change based on on-chain or irl events.

This contract display different trait look based on Nouns DAO auction state. When the auction is active, T-Shirt(accessory trait) is red coloured, but when auction ends and it's time to play FOMO, the t-shirt appearance will change to green colour, signalling that it's FOMO game time.

### Structure

Repo consists of two parts:

#### `/art`

It contains code for preparing(RLE encoding) art for storage in the contact.

#### `/contracts`

It contains modified ERC1155 token contract that implements `IComposablePart` so it can be used for composing.
